# Recognition-and-Categorization-of-Malaria-Parasite-Using-Image-Processing
A system for computer-based recognition and classification of Malaria using images of blood smears instead of the time-consuming process of manual inspection and categorisation of malarial parasites.

The proposed system suggests the images are loaded and pre-processed which involves the conversion of images to a negative binary image. Based on the contour values the malarial cell is detected and then classified into one of its four types. (i.e. P.falciparum, P.vivax, P.malariae and P.ovale)
The main steps are:
1. Pre-processing the blood smear image.
2. Detection and counting of the number of RBCs.
3. Classification of malaria parasite species.
